# angular2-scratch

This is a project setup for angular2 and webpack. It uses the materialize framework.

Clone the project and then run

```
npm install
typings install
npm run build
```

(You may need to install the `typings` binary. If you get an error saying that
  `typings` is undefined, run `npm install typings -g`)
Then load up the `index.html` page in `dist/index.html`.
